# Dragon Script

A JavaScript (and TypeScript) Engine, inspired by JavaScript Core's Architecture

The Project is still in it's in it's infancy, so don't expcet too much.
For parsing JavaScript and TypeScript [`swc`](https://github.com/swc-project/swc) is used.
I am currently trying to come up with a good Bytecode for the engine.
